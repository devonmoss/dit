# EnhancedRaceMode Component Decomposition

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for breaking down the large `EnhancedRaceMode` component into smaller, more maintainable pieces. Each section represents a domain of functionality that can be extracted into separate hooks or components.

## 3. Participant Management

Move participant-related functionality to dedicated components:

- **`RaceParticipantsManager`** - Handle users joining/leaving races
- **`RacePresenceTracker`** - Real-time online status tracking

## 4. Progress Tracking

Create a dedicated hook for race progress:

- **`useRaceProgressTracker`** - Handle progress updates, error counting, and broadcasting

## 5. Invitation Logic

Extract invitation functionality:

- **`useRaceInvitations`** - Logic for sending and receiving race invitations

## 6. Race State Management

Implement a context-based approach to reduce prop drilling:

- **`RaceStateProvider`** - Central state management for race data
- **`useRaceState`** - Hook to access race state throughout components

## After the main decomp
After breaking those out we can make these improvements to further improve it.

## 7. Utility Components

Create reusable UI components:

- **`RaceControls`** - Buttons and controls for race actions
- **`RaceTimer`** - Handle race timing display
- **`RaceModeSpecificUI`** - Mode-dependent user interface elements

## 8. State Management Improvements

Further enhance state management after initial component extraction:

- **Move race state into context** - Transition more state to dedicated context
- **Ensure consistent updates** - Standardize how state is updated across components
- **Reduce prop drilling** - Minimize the passing of props through multiple levels

## 9. Type Safety Enhancements

Improve typing throughout the codebase:

- **Address ESLint warnings** - Fix all `any` type warnings
- **Define better interfaces** - Create more specific types for race data
- **Clean up imports** - Remove unused imports and variables
- **Enforce strict typing** - Ensure all function parameters and returns are properly typed

## 10. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling:

- **Add error boundaries** - Prevent entire UI crashes on component errors
- **Implement recovery mechanisms** - Add logic to recover from failures gracefully
- **User-friendly messages** - Display helpful error messages to users
- **Logging** - Improve error logging for debugging

## 11. Performance Optimization

Optimize component performance:

- **Fix dependency warnings** - Address React Hook dependency array warnings
- **Implement memoization** - Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` appropriately
- **Prevent re-renders** - Identify and fix unnecessary component re-renders
- **Code splitting** - Split code to reduce initial load time

## Conclusion

This decomposition will transform the main component into primarily a coordinator that manages which stage is active and connects the various sub-components. Each extracted piece will handle a specific concern, making the code more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.

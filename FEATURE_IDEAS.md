# Feature Ideas

Below is a list of proposed features for the Morse code training and POTA app. Each feature includes a brief description and rationale.

## 1. Morse Code Sending Trainer
- Mimic the use of an iambic paddle/electric keyer using left and right arrow keys.
- Includes lessons and a “Zen” mode where users can freely key, view dits and dahs live,
  then after a pause, translate input into English to review their transmissions.

## 2. POTA Contact Exercises
- Several exercises to prepare users for Parks on the Air (POTA) contacts as both hunters
  and activators.
- Primary objective: build confidence for real-world POTA participation.

## 3. Continuous Mode
- App plays a sequence of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 characters; user types responses live.
- Variant: 3-strike continuous mode where characters stream until the user falls behind
  or makes three mistakes.

## 4. Login and Account Management
- Enable user registration and authentication (email/password, Google, GitHub).
- Persist test results and level progress beyond localStorage to backend storage.

## 5. Realistic Radio Distortion
- Introduce realistic static and signal distortions (beyond simple noise)
  to simulate HAM radio conditions and build user confidence.

## 6. Performance Metrics Tracking
- Measure and store recognition time per character.
- Provide dashboards so users can identify difficult characters and track improvement over time.

## 7. Custom Call Sign Playback
- Allow users to register their call signs.
- Clicking a call sign plays it back in Morse code audio/visual format.

## 8. Advanced Levels and Prosigns
- Add more learning levels that include copying and transmitting prosigns.

## 9. Custom Level Creation and Sharing
- Users can craft custom practice levels based on specific character sets or themes.
- Shared custom levels include leaderboards for friendly competition.

## 10. Adaptive Weakness-Focused Levels
- Dynamically generate practice levels focusing on each user’s weakest characters.

## 11. Interactive POTA Simulation
- Simulate full POTA-style activator/hunter interactions, including pileup scenarios.
- Incorporate standard POTA scripts for guided practice.

## 12. Custom Color Schemes
- Allow users to create and preview custom UI color schemes (backgrounds, text, keyer elements).
- Enable submission of themes to a public GitHub repository for community sharing.
- Provide an in-app gallery for browsing, previewing, and installing community-contributed schemes.

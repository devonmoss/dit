# Feature Ideas

This document captures feature ideas for future development of the Morse code training application. Items are organized by feature category with brief descriptions and rationales.

## Training Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Learning Modules
- **Prosign Training**: Add dedicated levels for copying and transmitting prosigns used in CW operations
- **Punctuation Training**: Create structured lessons for common Morse punctuation marks
- **Call Sign Practice**: Generate properly formatted call signs for practice exercises

### 2. Specialized Practice Modes
- **Continuous Mode**: 
  - Stream sequences of 5-25 characters for user to type in real-time
  - 3-strike variant where characters stream until the user falls behind or makes three mistakes
- **Adaptive Difficulty**:
  - Dynamically generate practice focusing on the user's weakest characters
  - Gradually increase difficulty based on user performance
- **Realistic Radio Conditions**:
  - Introduce authentic static and signal distortions beyond simple noise
  - Simulate challenging HAM radio conditions to build operator confidence

### 3. POTA (Parks on the Air) Integration
- **Contact Exercises**: Prepare users for POTA contacts as both hunters and activators
- **Interactive Simulation**: Simulate full POTA-style interactions, including pileup scenarios
- **Standard Scripts**: Incorporate common POTA scripts for guided practice

### 4. Training Mode UI Improvements
- **Visual Feedback Animations**: Replace text indicators like "fast answer" with visual animations
- **Sending Mode Feedback**: Provide visual feedback for sending training (currently only in copy mode)
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Level completion sounds
  - Countdown audio cues
  - Race finish sound effects

## User Experience

### 1. Theme Customization
- **Custom Color Schemes**: Allow users to create and preview custom UI themes
- **Community Sharing**: Enable users to submit themes to a public repository
- **Theme Gallery**: Provide in-app browsing and installation of community themes

### 2. UI Enhancement
- **Iconography System**: Add consistent icons throughout the interface:
  - Copy mode
  - Send mode
  - Time-based practice
  - Word-based practice
  - Training mode
  - Race mode (checkered flag)
  - Login/logout
  - Settings

### 3. User Profile and Statistics
- **User Stats Dashboard**: Rename "My Progress" to "User Stats" with improved accessibility
- **Activity Visualization**: Display heatmaps of user practice sessions
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track and visualize character recognition times
  - Provide analytics to identify difficult characters
  - Show improvement trends over time

### 4. Authentication Improvements
- **Streamlined Signup**: Log users in immediately after account creation
- **Profile Features**: Add custom call sign registration and playback

## Community and Competition

### 1. Custom Content Creation
- **User-Created Levels**: Allow users to build custom practice levels based on specific characters/themes
- **Sharing System**: Add functionality to share custom levels with other users
- **Leaderboards**: Implement friendly competition with level-specific leaderboards

### 2. Race Mode Refinements
- **Race Replay**: Add "play again" functionality for race participants
- **Character Set Selection**: Allow races with different character sets
- **WPM Calculation**: Verify WPM calculation methodology for CW-specific metrics
- **Technical Improvements**: Evaluate use of Supabase realtime schema

## Miscellaneous

### 1. Technical Enhancements
- **Analytics**: Implement Vercel analytics and performance tracking
- **Debug Logging**: Cleanup excessive console logging

# Roadmap

- Develop training levels for punctuation, specifying the most commonly used punctuation marks and creating exercises that gradually increase in complexity.
- Develop training levels for prosigns (shorthand used in CW operations), defining a progression of learning modules from basic prosigns to advanced combinations.
- Develop training levels for call signs, generating random but properly formatted call signs based on researched country-specific prefixes and issuance rules to favor geographic relevance.

I'll help you add a feature idea or refinement to the FEATURE_IDEAS.md file. I'll analyze the idea "$ARGUMENTS" and properly integrate it into the document.

1. First, I'll read the current FEATURE_IDEAS.md file to understand the existing content and structure.
2. I'll analyze your feature idea to determine:
   - If it's a new feature or a refinement of an existing one
   - Which category it best fits into
   - How to format and add it appropriately

3. I'll then update the FEATURE_IDEAS.md file with your new idea, ensuring proper formatting and organization.

Please wait while I analyze your feature idea and update the document...

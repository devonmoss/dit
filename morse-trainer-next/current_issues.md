placeholders for other modes:
    - time: Coming soon! Complete as many characters as possible in a set amount of time.
    - words: Coming soon! Identify or send words of various sizes. 
    - get rid of 'custom'

race mode: 
    - lol, am i supposed to use the 'realtime' schema?
    - implement send mode
    - is the WPM calculation correct? Is it special for CW?
    - allow the users to play again. incorporate some way for them to play again with different char set

login should require username creation.
    - the app should not use any tables that have the email address (except a user settings page)
    - we always use either their username if logged in, never their email.
    - hitting the login button should bring you to a dedicated /login page

general app navigation
    - clicking on training when on a race screen should bring you either to /training or /
    - clicking words should bring you to /words
    - clicking time should bring you to /time
    - clicking on race or navigating back to /race should bring up the race creation page even if you were already in a race


my progress:
    - might want to rename to something more like 'user stats' and make it reachable from clicking on the username
    - show heatmap of user activity
    - show insightful charts about recognition of each character

implement an xp and leveling system
    - you get points for doing trainings, tests, races. (maybe just points for every char identified or sent?)
